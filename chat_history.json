Here's a vision for the first version:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Dashboard:** A welcoming home screen displaying the user's crypto balances, transaction history, and a summary of their portfolio performance.\n*   **Wallet:** Functionality to manage different cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin). This includes sending, receiving, and storing cryptocurrencies securely.\n*   **Transaction History:** A detailed record of all crypto transactions, with filters for date, currency, and transaction type.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean interface)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#6200EE` (A vibrant purple for main actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#03DAC5` (Teal as an accent color)\n    *   Accent: `#BB86FC` (A lighter purple for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#FF4081` (Pink for important notifications or actions)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Implement the dashboard layout with crypto balances and transaction summaries.\n    *   Create placeholders for wallet management features.\n    *   Design the transaction history section.\n2.  **Create a new component for Wallet Management:**\n    *   Create a new file in the `components` folder called `Wallet.tsx`.\n    *   Implement the UI for managing different cryptocurrency wallets (sending, receiving, storing).\n3.  **Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:**\n    *   Ensure the tab bar navigation includes a \"Wallet\" tab, linking to the `Wallet.tsx` component.\n4.  **Remove `modalDemos` array:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not relevant to the app's purpose.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T01:02:53.299681"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a mobile banking app for cryptocurrencies.
